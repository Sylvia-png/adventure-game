# adventure-game
using with python
-Is a text-based game in choose your own adventure style,and it was developed using python.
-Here I used different programming components such as while loops, if conditions, functions and imports.
-The result was a game that you can play in the terminal, I find this exercise really fun to work on because I combined creativity and logic to make the game.
